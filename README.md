# 3D Printer: Garden Timelapse Enclosure
An enclosure for Raspberry Pi HQ camera, up to two Raspberry Pi Zero's and a 40mm fan

## Overview

This collection of files will allow you to print a 3D print an enclosure for a Timelapse Camera.  This enclosure case will hold a Raspberry Pi HQ Camera (or similar dimensioned camera from Arducam), one to two Raspberry Pi Zero WH boards, and optionally a Trinket M0 board.  

The case also supports mounting a **5v** 40mm fan.   Noctua fans are suggested due to their quiet operation and lengthy warranty.   They also included the 3-pin to 2-pin adapter which will allow you connect it directly to pins 4 and 6 of your Raspberry Pi's GPIO.

## Printing Instructions

:warning: **IMPORTANT:** Please review each part in your slicing software before printing to ensure a logical face is touching the build plate!      

These print settings were used to print using a Creality CR-6 SE using Hatchbox Cool Gray 1.75mm PLA.   You may need to adjust these settings slightly for other printer and filament combinations.

- Print Resolution: 0.2
- Infill (unless otherwise noted below): 30%
- Supports (unless otherwise noted below): No
- Printing Temperature: 200C
- Build Plate Temperature: 60C
- Part-specific notes:
  - **Main Box.stl** For this piece you will need to print a "Touching Buildplate" support for overhanging angles exceeding 47Â°.  This is the only piece that needs to be printed with supports.
  
## Cutting Instructions.
The **Camera Lens Felt Seal.studio3** file can be used to cut a felt seal using a Silhouette Cameo cutting machine.   You may need to make multiple cut passes to cut through the felt.   This seal can also cut by hand with a steady hand.
